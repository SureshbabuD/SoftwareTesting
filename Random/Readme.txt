a. What is your design and implementation?

I have created blocking queue which is used as sharing data structure between Randomizer and PrimeRandomizer. The PrimeRandomizer takes the input randomly and calculate whether the integer is prime or not and put it in shared blocking queue.
The Randomizer loops and takes the integer from blocking queue and prints it.
